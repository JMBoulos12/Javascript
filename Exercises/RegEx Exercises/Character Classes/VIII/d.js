  You can think of character classes as characters with special meaning. 
  They are recognized as special when you place the \ before the character.

  Here are a list of the characters classes in JavaScript:

  ., \cX, \d, \D, \f, \n, \r, \s, \S, \t, \v, \w, \W, \0, \xhh, \uhhhh, \uhhhhh, [\b]

  Extract the addresses from this string:

  const str = "123 Redding Dr. 1560 Knoxville Ave. 3030 Norwalk Dr. 5 South St."
  // ["123 Redding Dr.", "1560 Knoxville Ave.", "3030 Norwalk Dr.", "5 South St."]
  
  Write the regular expression that matches all street addresses. 
  All street addresses begin with a number. Use the character class \d in your expression.
