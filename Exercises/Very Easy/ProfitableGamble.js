/*
  Create a function that takes three arguments prob, prize, pay and returns true if prob * prize > pay; otherwise return false.
  To illustrate:
  profitableGamble(0.2, 50, 9)
  ... should yield true, since the net profit is 1 (0.2 * 50 - 9), and 1 > 0.
  
  Examples  :
  profitableGamble(0.2, 50, 9) ➞ true
  profitableGamble(0.9, 1, 2) ➞ false
  profitableGamble(0.9, 3, 2) ➞ true
  
  Notes :
  A profitable gamble is a game that yields a positive net profit, where net profit is calculated in the following manner: net_outcome = probability_of_winning * prize - cost_of_playing.
