/*
  In JavaScript, you can generate a random number with the Math.random() function.

  Math.random() returns a random floating-point number ranging from 0 to less than 1 (inclusive of 0 and exclusive of 1)
  
  Output  :
  0.5856407221615856
  Here, we have declared a variable a and assigned it a random number greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1.

  Note: You might get a different output in the above program as Math.random() will generate a random number.
