This program computes roots of a quadratic equation when its coefficients are known.

The standard form of a quadratic equation is:

ax2 + bx + c = 0, where
a, b and c are real numbers and
a ≠ 0

To find the roots of such equation, we use the formula,
(root1,root2) = (-b ± √b2-4ac)/2

The term b2-4ac is known as the discriminant of a quadratic equation. It tells the nature of the roots.

1-  If the discriminant is greater than 0, the roots are real and different.
2-  If the discriminant is equal to 0, the roots are real and equal.
3-  If the discriminant is less than 0, the roots are complex and different.
