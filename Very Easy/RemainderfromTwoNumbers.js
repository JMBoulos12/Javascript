  There is a single operator in JavaScript, capable of providing the remainder of a division operation. 
  Two numbers are passed as parameters. The first parameter divided by the second parameter will have a remainder, possibly zero. 
  Return that value.
  
  Examples  :
  remainder(1, 3) ➞ 1
  remainder(3, 4) ➞ 3
  remainder(-9, 45) ➞ -9
  remainder(5, 5) ➞ 0
